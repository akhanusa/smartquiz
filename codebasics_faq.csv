What is the role of an IGP when running iBGP?,"An IGP ensures IP reachability between iBGP peers, which do not need to be directly connected."
Can BGP be used for internal routing within a single AS?,"Yes, iBGP is used for internal routing, but it's typically combined with an IGP that handles the actual forwarding path."
What is the difference between `next-hop-self` and `allowas-in`?,"`next-hop-self` manipulates the next-hop attribute for iBGP. `allowas-in` allows a router to accept routes that contain its own ASN in the AS_PATH, typically for specific scenarios like multi-homed customers."
What is BGP route poisoning?,A method where a router advertises a route with an unreachable metric or removes it from its BGP table to indicate that the route is no longer valid.

What is the role of the DMVPN Hub?,"The hub acts as the NHRP server, maintaining a database of public and private IP addresses for all registered spokes, and initially forwarding spoke-to-spoke traffic."
What is the role of a DMVPN Spoke?,A spoke is a remote site router that registers its public and private IP addresses with the hub and can dynamically establish tunnels to other spokes.
How does a spoke learn the public IP of another spoke?,It queries the NHRP server (the hub) to resolve the private IP of the destination spoke to its public IP.

What is the significance of `ip nhrp map` commands on the hub?,"These are not always required on the hub, as spokes register dynamically. They are used on spokes for hub's public IP."
What is the significance of `ip nhrp network-id`?,It logically groups DMVPN routers within the same NHRP domain. It must be unique for each DMVPN network.
What are the three phases of DMVPN deployment?,"Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3."
What are the characteristics of DMVPN Phase 1?,Hub-and-spoke only. All spoke-to-spoke traffic must pass through the hub. Routing protocols run between hub and spokes.
What are the characteristics of DMVPN Phase 2?,Spoke-to-spoke tunnels are dynamically built after an initial connection through the hub. All traffic can bypass the hub directly.
What are the characteristics of DMVPN Phase 3?,"Enhances Phase 2 with per-packet redirection from the hub, allowing the hub to inform spokes of direct paths even if the hub is involved in the initial routing decision."

What routing protocols can be used over DMVPN?,"EIGRP, OSPF, BGP, and static routing."
What is a common challenge when running OSPF over DMVPN?,OSPF's default behavior for multi-access networks (DR/BDR election) can cause issues. Setting `ip ospf network broadcast` or `point-to-multipoint` is often needed.
What OSPF network type is often used for DMVPN?,"`ip ospf network broadcast` (if hub is DR) or `ip ospf network point-to-multipoint non-broadcast` (for no DR/BDR, more stable)."
What EIGRP command is crucial for DMVPN spokes to propagate routes correctly?,`no ip split-horizon eigrp <ASN>` on the tunnel interface.
Why is `no ip split-horizon` needed for EIGRP on DMVPN spokes?,"Because EIGRP split-horizon prevents a router from advertising a route out the same interface it was learned on, which would block spoke-to-spoke route advertisement."
What is the purpose of `tunnel source` and `tunnel destination` on the mGRE tunnel interface?,`tunnel source` is the router's public IP. `tunnel destination` is NOT used on the hub (for mGRE) but is the hub's public IP on spokes.

What is the role of a crypto profile in DMVPN?,"To define the IPsec parameters (transform set, IKEv2 profile, PFS) applied to the mGRE tunnel interface for encryption."
How does a spoke find the hub's NHRP server?,It's explicitly configured using `ip nhrp map nhs <hub_private_ip> <hub_public_ip>` and `ip nhrp network-id`.
What is the maximum number of spokes a DMVPN hub can support?,"Theoretically thousands, practically limited by hub router CPU, memory, and routing table size (e.g., several hundreds to a few thousands)."
How does DMVPN aid in disaster recovery for remote sites?,"By allowing spoke-to-spoke communication, if the hub fails, spokes might still be able to communicate directly if their tunnels are already up."
What is the concept of a 'dual-hub' DMVPN deployment?,Deploying two (or more) redundant hubs to provide high availability and load balancing for DMVPN connectivity.
How do spokes know which hub to register with in a dual-hub setup?,"Often via multiple `ip nhrp map` entries pointing to both hubs, or by using routing metrics/priorities."
What are common troubleshooting commands for DMVPN?,"`show dmvpn`, `show ip nhrp`, `show crypto ikev2 sa`, `show crypto ipsec sa`, `debug ip nhrp`."
What does `show dmvpn` provide?,"A summary of the DMVPN tunnel status, including the local tunnel interface, hub/spoke roles, and peer information."
What does `show ip nhrp` display?,"The NHRP cache entries, showing the mapping between private and public IP addresses for peers."
What indicates a spoke-to-spoke tunnel is active in `show ip nhrp`?,"An entry showing a direct mapping between two spokes, usually with an 'up' status."
What is a common cause for spoke-to-spoke tunnels not forming in Phase 2/3?,"Mismatched routing protocol configurations, ACLs blocking GRE/IPsec, or NHRP resolution failures."
How does DMVPN handle 'Next-Hop-Self' for routing protocols?,"For spoke-to-spoke traffic, NHRP resolves the next hop directly, so `next-hop-self` is typically not needed on the tunnel interface for iBGP/EIGRP."
What is a `crypto map` equivalent in modern DMVPN configurations?,A `crypto ipsec profile` applied to the tunnel interface.
Does DMVPN require static configuration for every spoke-to-spoke connection?,"No, that's its main advantage; NHRP dynamically discovers and establishes spoke-to-spoke tunnels."

Why is PIM called 'Protocol Independent'?,Because it does not rely on a specific unicast routing protocol (like OSPF or EIGRP); it uses the unicast routing table created by any IGP.
What are the two main modes of PIM?,PIM-Dense Mode (PIM-DM) and PIM-Sparse Mode (PIM-SM).
Briefly describe how PIM-DM works.,"It uses a 'flood and prune' mechanism, initially flooding multicast traffic to all segments and then pruning branches that do not have active receivers."
